# CodeDay
This will contain projects done during CodeDay
* This project will convert a string to a musical sound

#General idea
This project is meant to evolve into a mini messenger that would involve two parties that can use the service to obtain
a different type of message contained within a song

 if #%2  = 1 then divide by ending of number  < 5 not more depending on size of array 
		ex. divide by 3 if < 20 and so on
	else 
		divide by multiple of 2^power depending on size 

make a search query to find the words in binary and play the dependent sound for that word 
break it in 2 - 4 - 8 - so on
for 2 bits
2^2 = 4
00
01
10
11

for 3 bits
2^3 = 8
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111

for 4 bits
2^4 = 16
0000
0001
0010
0011 
0100
0101
0110
0111
1000
1001
1010
1011
1101
1100
1110
1111

There should also be account for the number of 1 and 0 so that they could be used to either choose a library of 
sounds with stronger entonations or less, 0 for less, 1 for more
